# Gestalt
 C++ and SFML 2D Game Engine

## Compilation
To compile, you'll need SFML (version 2.5). Follow the official docs about how to properly compile and link SFML in Visual Studio on Windows. The static version of SFML is recommended. Also it's recommended to link all the modules of SFML and their respective dependencies.
Also note that by default the audio folder in resources will be ignored by git, so you must manually create a new folder named audio in resources and copy paste any music file of your choice there (must be named whitebat with .ogg format).

## Run game executable
 Copy x64/Release/ and Gestalt/resources/ to a common directory, then run Gestalt.exe
