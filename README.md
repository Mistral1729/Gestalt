# Gestalt
 C++ SFML Engine

## Run game executable
 Copy x64/Debug/ and Gestalt/resources/ to a common directory, then run Gestalt.exe

### To learn AI and procedural generation for C++ game engine development, you can follow these steps:

Start by learning the basics of C++ programming, including data types, variables, control structures, and object-oriented programming. You can find online tutorials, books, or courses to help you learn C++.

Next, learn about game engine development using C++. This will involve learning about graphics rendering, physics simulation, and other game engine systems. You can find online tutorials or resources specifically for game engine development, or you can learn about game engines by building your own simple game engine from scratch.

To learn about AI, you can start by learning about basic AI concepts such as decision trees, minimax algorithms, and neural networks. You can also learn about specific AI techniques used in games, such as pathfinding, decision-making, and behavior trees.

To learn about procedural generation, you can start by learning about algorithms and techniques for generating content algorithmically, such as random number generation, noise functions, and machine learning. You can also learn about specific techniques used in games, such as generating levels, terrain, or non-player characters.

Practice implementing AI and procedural generation techniques in your game engine. You can try building simple games or demos that use these techniques, or you can try adding AI and procedural generation features to an existing game engine.

Keep learning and staying up to date with new developments in AI and procedural generation. You can do this by reading research papers, attending conferences and workshops, and staying active in online communities related to game development.
